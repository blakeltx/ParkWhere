This is my Capstone project that I did with 4 people:

1. Blake Lauritsen (me): Backend-Developer
2. Tristan Paschall: Frontend Developer
3. William Hatcher: Technical Lead
4. Michelle Thompson: Project Manager

The project was to create an IPhone App called ParkWhere.

ParkWhere is designed to help someone park based on the location they wish to go to (say Kyle Field), their permits (or no permits), special events going on (such as a football game), type of lot (Surface lot vs garage), lot specific features (electric vehicle parking or Visitor), and occupancy (user reported). ParkWhere will generate a list of Lots/Garages that they are allowed to park at given the various fields filled in the order of nearest to furthest compared to the Point of Interest selected (Ex: Kyle Field). Clicking on the lot/garage will allow the user to view various information about the lot/garage. Clicking on the arrow will transfer the user out of the app to the user's preferenced navigation app (apple maps, google maps, Waze) with the destination filled in tbased on the selected lot/garage.
