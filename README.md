This is my Capstone project that I did with 4 people:

1. Blake Lauritsen (me): Backend-Developer
2. Tristan Paschall: Frontend Developer
3. William Hatcher: Technical Lead
4. Michelle Thompson: Project Manager

The project was to create an IPhone App called ParkWhere.

ParkWhere is designed to help someone park based on their permits (or no permits), special events going on (such as a football game), type of lot (Surface lot vs garage), and lot specific features (electric vehicle parking or Visitor).
